Those notes are a step-by-step guide for how a tender should be handled
  in the app.

  Think of it as a "game plan":


   * Each Stage (like Under Preview) is a step in the process.
   * Each action (like Go/No-Go) is a decision you can make at that step.
   * The notes tell you exactly where the tender goes next based on your
     decision.

  For example: At the "Under Preview" step, if you decide "GO," the
  tender moves to the "Payment Pending" step.


  In short, the notes are the rules for moving a tender through its
  lifecycle within the app.

✦ The point of the app is to help a business win more contracts.

  It takes the complicated, multi-step process of bidding for a tender and
   makes it simple and organized. It ensures the team follows the correct
  steps (like the ones in the notes), doesn't miss deadlines, and can
  easily work together.


  Who will use it?

  The employees of a company that bids on tenders, such as:


   * Managers who decide which projects to bid on.
   * *   Managers** who decide which projects to bid on.
   * Technical and financial experts who write the proposals.
   * Team leaders who review the bids and track the company's win/loss
     record.

✦ Of course. Let's walk through the journey of a single tender according
  to those notes.

  Think of the notes as a flowchart or a "choose your own adventure" story
   for a business proposal.


  Step 1: A New Opportunity
   * Stage: Under Preview
   * Meaning: Your team has found a new tender. The first decision is
     whether to even try to win it.
   * Actions:
       * If you decide "Go" (you want to compete), the tender moves to
         Payment Pending.
       * If you decide "No-Go" (it's not a good fit), the tender is marked
          as Cancelled.


  Step 2: Paying the Entry Fee
   * Stage: Payment Pending
   * Meaning: Many tenders require a fee to get the official documents.
     This is the reminder to pay it.
   * Actions:
       * Once you've "Paid", the tender moves to Pending Preparing 
         Proposals.
       * If you change your mind, you can "Cancel" it.


  Step 3: Getting Ready to Work
   * Stage: Pending Preparing Proposals
   * Meaning: You've paid the fee and are ready to begin the actual work
     of writing the proposal.
   * Actions:
       * When the team is ready, they "Start Preparing", and the tender
         moves to Preparing Proposals.
       * Or, you can still "Cancel".


  Step 4: Writing the Proposal
   * Stage: Preparing Proposals
   * Meaning: The team is actively writing the technical and financial
     documents for the bid.
   * Actions:
       * When the draft is done, you mark it as "Finished Preparing 
         Proposals", and it moves to Reviewing Proposals for an internal
         check.
       * Or, you can "Cancel".


  Step 5: Internal Review
   * Stage: Reviewing Proposal
   * Meaning: Before sending the proposal to the client, your own team
     leaders review it for quality.
   * Actions:
       * If they "Accept" it, the proposal is approved and moves to
         Pending Submitting.
       * If they "Reject" it (e.g., they find errors), it goes back to the
          Preparing Proposals stage to be fixed.


  Step 6: Ready to Send
   * Stage: Pending Submitting
   * Meaning: The proposal is approved and ready to be sent off.
   * Actions:
       * When you officially "Submit" it, the tender moves to the
         Submitted stage.
       * If you decide not to submit at the last minute, you can "Cancel".


  Step 7: Waiting for the Result
   * Stage: Submitted
   * Meaning: You have submitted your bid and are waiting for the client
     to make their decision.
   * Final Outcomes: From here, the tender will eventually be marked as
     `Won` or `Lost`.

  The `Cancelled` stage is a final state for any tender dropped during
  the process.


  So, the notes are simply the precise, step-by-step path that every
  tender follows within the application.
